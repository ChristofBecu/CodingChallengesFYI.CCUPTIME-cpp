# Build Your Own Uptime Monitor Service (c++)
This challenge is to build your own uptime monitoring service. There are many such services and if you work for a company that runs an Internet facing property your company probably uses one of the well known ones such as Pingdom, pusetic, Uptime or Uptime Robot.

Essentially they will monitor your website / API endpoint and provide alerts when it is down so your on-call engineers can restore it ASAP. Some also offer alerts if the latency exceeds a threshold and can monitor itâ€™s availability from multiple geographical locations.

Many will provide historic records of uptime, latency and alerts - useful for tracking your SLIs and SLAs.
